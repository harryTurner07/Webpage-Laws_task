            <!--
                This details what the computer misuse act is.
            -->
            <h1>What is the Computer Misuse Act?</h1>
            <p>The computer misuse act makes it a criminal offense to do any of these things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make any unauthorised access to computer material</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>with intent to fabricate or commit commision of futher offenses</li>
                    <p>
                        *mainly blackmail - where personal information is used to hold the victim hostage
                        usually to obtain money.*
                    </p>
                    <li>with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to imparing, the operation of a computer</li>
                    <p>
                        *means to distribute malware as an example.*
                    </p>
                </ul>
            </ul>

                Details what the law is aimed at - what it intends to stop or reduce and what it includes.
            -->
            <h2>What is this law aimed at, and what does it include?</h2>
            <p>
                The law is aimed at those that wish to disrupt and possibly destory people's machines or just wish to spread malicious things over the internet - typically referred to as 'hackers'.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many feature and techniques in play to minimise the damage done to those affected. Some include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol.</li>
                <p>
                    This enables an encrypted link between computers to ensure the security of a transaction or communication.
                </p>
                <li>A firewall which prevents certain traffic from reaching the computer</li>
                <p>
                    A firewall can limit the access of any external users connecting to the system or allow no access at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A firewall is the primary defence against DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distibuted Denial of Service) attacks - this is when a lot of data is being sent to one system at once, meaning that the system receiving the data can slow down or even crash.
                </p>
            </ol>

            <h1>It's important to note that all methods don't always keep us safe.</h1>
            <p>So how can we be more safe?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep a sort of physical security</li>
                <p>
                    This can be just writing your passwords or such, on a physical piece of paper - but keep in mind you need to also keep this safe.
                </p>
                <li>Similar to the first one, be aware of "Shoulder Surfers"</li>
                <p>
                    This refers to people looking over your shoulder mostly when you are inputting passwords. This doesn't mean you have to be looking over your shoulder every few seconds, but mainly be aware in crowded areas such as libraries.
                </p>
            </ol>
            <p>A website to view some of the ways to keep you safe in greater detail is by <a href="https://security.virginia.edu/prevent-it-abuse">->this<-</a> website.</p>

            <h3>What changes have occured?</h3>
            <p>The best way to look at the contents and the more indepth changes to the Misuse Act is by going onto the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents">UK Gov website</a>.</p>
            <p>
                The legislation has been updated and reviewed multiple times in order to be up to date on recent matters, but very recently there was a meeting to discuss whether or not it should be updated.
            </p>
            <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2022-0082/">The Government has said that, whilst the Computer Misuse Act continues to be a key part of the response against cybercrime, changes to society's use of the internet in the last thirty years and an increasing threat from cyber criminals mean that the Act should be reviewed to ensure it is effective in protecting against the threat of cybercrime</a>
